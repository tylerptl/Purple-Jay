# 2023 Hackthebox CTF Training
This repo is best viewed in [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/). Once installed, open this repo as an Obsidian Vault.
## Goal
This training is meant to provide you a basic technical understanding of how to exploit common threats found in the [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) by providing you with 4 separate standalone vulnerable machines from Hackthebox. Each machine will have unique exploit killchains that you will need to carry out in order to fully compromise the box - this is determined by having root (linux) or system authority (windows) access to the machine. With this access, you will need to access the content of two 'flags' (text files containing a unique hash) found on the machines - one low privilege flag, and one requiring total compromise. 

Note: This is a gamified environment where the end goal is to gain unrestricted access to the machines - this should be not be considered indiciative of what an attack may look like in real life, as these labs do not take into consideration stealth, persistence, lateral movement, or other high-value vectors.
